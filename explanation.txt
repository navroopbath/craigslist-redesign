  I chose to create a nav bar that would be prominent on the top of 
  every page. Also, since the two most important functions of Craigslist
  are searching for listings and creating new listings, I integrated
  those two features in the nav bar so that a user can access those two
  features from any page. I made the search bar wide so that it attracts the
  user's attention to the top-left immediately.

  Also, the logo serves as a piece of functionality allowing a user to
  access the homepage from anywhere. Lastly, I placed the user's name and
  a drop-down arrow which would allow them to access their various user 
  settings/prior posts easily.
